Library for Vicor's BCM4414 DC/DC regulator.

# Background
Many EV Formula Student teams use 600V tractive system voltage. The higher the voltage, the thinner the cables. 
To power the low voltage electronics you can do either of 2 things. 

1. A separate low voltage battery pack. 
2. A DC/DC regulator. (Usually 12V or 24V).

It is difficult to find a rule compliant regulator. One such regulator is Vicor's BCM4414.
